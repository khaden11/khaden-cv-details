README FILE

This is my coursework 3 entry of Jungle Run. Jungle
Run is a basic platforming game with a player,
enemies, platforms, special platforms, collectibles
etc. A lot of comments in the code can be found
to explain how the game was built and will give
websites when needed to reference code and images
used.

To run the game, open up the 
GAMECOURSEWORKFINALVERSION.py and run it.
