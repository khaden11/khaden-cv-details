# Kieran Haden CV Details

Here is an overview of some coding projects I have been taking part in recently:

C elegans Project
-----------------

In the summer of 2013, I have started a project looking into developing
evolutionary algorithms for parameter optimisation in muscle contractions of the
C elegans model. Some of the current code is located in the C elegans folder.

App Development
---------------

From January 2014, I have been part of a scrum team developing an app for 
buying tickets for gigs/events. The current apk for the app is available to
download (from the App Example folder) and the link below is for the current 
(unfinished) website.

Pygame Project
---------------

In January 2013, I developed a simple platforming game using Python (files found
above), which has lead me to move onto the Unity editor and I am currently in
the process of developing multiple trials for iOs/android games.
